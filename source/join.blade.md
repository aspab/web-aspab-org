# Join Us
ASPAB Membership is available for anybody with an interest in any aspect of phycology and aquatic botany.

ASPAB has two chapters. Australian members belong to the Australian Chapter and are affiliated with FASTS (Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies). All other members belong to the New Zealand Chapter. The separation is for administrative purposes only as the Society operates as a single organisation.

## Student Membership

Students are an integral part of our society and to encourage students to join, special discounted membership rates apply to student members. Additional financial benefits to student membership include:

Discounted registration fees for annual conferences;
Travel awards to assist with attendance at national and international conferences;
Poster and oral presentation prizes at annual conferences;
Publication prize for the best publication by a student member.
Membership Forms

Membership is based on the financial year (1 July â€“ 30 June) and is renewed annually on 1 July. To join, please fill out one of the forms below and email to relevant chapter membership managers, listed below. Renewing members only need to complete a form if their contact details have changed.

## Mailing List

ASPAB has an email list, `ASPAB-list`, which we recommend all members subscribe to. This is used to distribute the Society newsletters, for the committee to communicate with members, and for members to communicate with one another. This is a low volume list and will not clutter up your inbox.

To subscribe to, or unsubscribe from ASPAB-list, please visit [lists.otago.ac.nz](http://lists.otago.ac.nz/listinfo/aspab-list).
