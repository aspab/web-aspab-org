# About ASPAB
The Australasian Society for Phycology and Aquatic Botany (ASPAB) is a professional scientific society, formally established in May 1980, that aims to promote, develop and assist the study of, or an interest in, phycology (the study of macro- and micro-algae such as seaweeds and phytoplankton) and aquatic botany (the study of aquatic plants) within Australasia and elsewhere. Additionally the society aims to establish and maintain communication between people interested in phycology and aquatic botany. To assist in promoting these aims ASPAB holds an annual conference (usually in November), produces a newsletter biannually and maintains an email discussion list for members (ASPAB-list).
